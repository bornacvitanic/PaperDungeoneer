# PaperDungeoneer

Step into the flickering torchlight of **Paper Dungeoneer**, a papercraft dungeon-crawler forged for **Mini Jam 177: Papercraft**. Play as one of four brave adventurers — **Barnarian**, **Rouge**, **Wizard**, or **Knight** — and descend into an endless labyrinth crafted from parchment and secrets.

In this dark, medieval world where ink and courage are your greatest weapons, fallen heroes from failed journeys rise again as skeletal foes. To defeat them, you must quickly inscribe words onto ancient parchment — each word a blow against the undead.

Your ultimate goal: **uncover the hidden sentence that reveals the secret of your chosen adventurer**. Every room hides a piece of mystery, with the air thick with medieval melodies, the scratch of quills on paper, and the flicker of dying torches.

## How to Play:

- **Type words quickly and accurately** to vanquish skeletons of past adventurers.
- **Reach the secret sentence** that unveils the fate and secret of your adventurer.
- Immerse yourself in the dark ambiance of hand-crafted papercraft dungeons.

**Controls:**
- `Ctrl + Backspace` → Clear the whole word instantly.
